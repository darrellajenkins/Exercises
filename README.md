# Exercises
This is a collection of selected exercises from the "100 Days of Python" course taught in the Angela Yu Udemy course.
In each exercise I attempted to augment the assignment to create something either more unique or challenging.
I welcome constructive feedback and ideas on improvements to stretch my thinking, and would love to join a group  
project. You can also find me on Replit, user @darrellajenkins.
