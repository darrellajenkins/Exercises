# Exercises
This is a collection of selected exercises from the "100 Days of Python" course taught by Dr. Angela Yu.
In each exercise I attempted to augment the given problem or assignment to create something either more unique or more aligned
to my personal coding directive.  I welcome constructive feedback/ideas on improvements to stretch my thinking.  You can 
also find me on Replit, user @darrellajenkins.
