# Exercises
This is a collection of selected exercises from the Angela Yu "100 Days of Python" Udemy course.
In each exercise I attempted to augment the assignment to create something either more unique or 
challenging. I welcome constructive feedback and ideas on improvements to stretch my thinking, 
and am available to join a group project.
